## Java Exceptions

As mentioned in the [Errors chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_errors.asp), different types of errors can occur while running a program - such as coding mistakes, invalid input, or unexpected situations.

When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an **exception** (throw an error).

---

## Exception Handling (try and catch)

Exception handling lets you catch and handle errors during runtime - so your program doesn't crash.

It uses different keywords:

The `try` statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The `catch` statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The `try` and `catch` keywords come in pairs:

### Syntax

```java
try {
  //  Block of code to try
}
catch(Exception e) {
  //  Block of code to handle errors
}
```

Consider the following example:

This will generate an error, because **myNumbers\[10\]** does not exist.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!
  }
}
```

The output will be something like this:

`    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10              at Main.main(Main.java:4)  `

**Note:** `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurs when you try to access an index number that does not exist.

If an error occurs, we can use `try...catch` to catch the error and execute some code to handle it:

### Example

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    }
  }
}
```

The output will be:

` Something went wrong.`

---

## Finally

The `finally` statement lets you execute code, after `try...catch`, regardless of the result:

### Example

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    } finally {
      System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
    }
  }
}
```

The output will be:

`  Something went wrong.   The 'try catch' is finished.  `

---

## The throw keyword

The `throw` statement allows you to create a custom error.

The `throw` statement is used together with an **exception type**. There are many exception types available in Java: `ArithmeticException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `SecurityException`, etc:

### Example

Throw an exception if **age** is below 18 (print "Access denied"). If age is 18 or older, print "Access granted":

```java
public class Main {
  static void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
      throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
  }
}
```

The output will be:

`  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.           at Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)           at Main.main(Main.java:12)  `

If **age** was 20, you would **not** get an exception:

### Example

```java
checkAge(20);
```

The output will be:

`  Access granted - You are old enough!  `

## Errors and Exception Types

The table below shows some of the most common errors and exceptions in Java, with a short description of each:

| Error/Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ArithmeticError | Occurs when a numeric calculation goes wrong |
| ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException | Occurs when trying to access an index number that does not exist in an array |
| ClassNotFoundException | Occurs when trying to access a class that does not exist |
| FileNotFoundException | Occurs when a file cannot be accessed |
| InputMismatchException | Occurs when entering wrong input (e.g. text in a numerical input) |
| IOException | Occurs when an input or output operation fails |
| NullPointerException | Occurs when trying to access an object referece that is `null` |
| NumberFormatException | Occurs when it is not possible to convert a specified string to a numeric type |
| StringIndexOutOfBoundsException | Occurs when trying to access a character in a String that does not exist |
